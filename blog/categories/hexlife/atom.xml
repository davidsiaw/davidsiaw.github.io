    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday while fooling around, I wanted to build a tri-star, but I made a mistake and made this instead:</p>

<p><img src="/images/hexlife/semistill-seed.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>But to my surprise I did not find a tri-star, instead this grew out of it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/hexlife/Y-semistill.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Since I had made changes to tint different generations with different colors, I wanted to test it. Wondering if I had introduced bugs, I went through my git history to make sure everything was fine. After reverting, it turned out I hadn&rsquo;t. It was just a variation I had never tried.</p>

<p>In my <a href="/blog/2014/11/21/hexlife/">earlier post</a>, I said that still lifes could not exist under the rules because cells could not live long enough, but these structures persisted. In other words, they were non-transient cells.</p>

<p>It turns out that most of the cells here had 3 neighbours, and that gave them a long lease on life. Also, all the way along the columns, there were no dead cells that had 2 cell neighbours, meaning that the cells would never die because of their spawn.</p>

<p>However, the ends are kept alive by an interesting &ldquo;flower&rdquo; oscillator that resembles the twinkling star oscillator, and this keeps the entire structure alive. Basically, you can make an infinitely long structure, but you must place the oscilators at the ends.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, I set out to create a simpler column.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hexlife/I-semistill.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>I call this kind of life form a Semi-still life, since a large proportion of it can be unchanging, but must be supported by oscillation.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are more of these under these rules&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wrote a simple Game of Life variation that runs on a hexagonal grid after viewing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#mediaviewer/File:Oscillator.gif">an example on Wikipedia</a>. The cells considered are the immediate neighbours. The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a dead cell is surrounded by 2 live cells, the dead cell becomes alive</li>
<li>if a live cell is surrounded by 3 or 4 live cells, it stays alive</li>
<li>in all other cases, the cell dies</li>
</ul>


<p>One of the interesting things about this set of rules is the absence of still life. The reason for this absence is that a cell can only be born under conditions where a live cell would otherwise die. This means that whenever a cell is born it is likely to kill its parents.</p>

<p>Hence the only known stable life forms in this set of rules at the moment are oscillators. No gliders have been found yet.</p>

<p>You can play with my implementation here: <a href="http://davidsiaw.github.io/hexlife/">http://davidsiaw.github.io/hexlife/</a></p>

<p>In my search for a glider in this set of rules, I found a bunch of oscillators and decided to record them:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Picture                                     </th>
<th> Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/2cell.png" alt="Alt text" />        </td>
<td> The <strong>2cell</strong> is the simplest and most common oscillator. It is left behind by almost any unstable life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/spinner.png" alt="Alt text" />      </td>
<td> The <strong>Spinner</strong> is another common oscillator that has a period of 2. It simply looks like it is spinning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/mouth.png" alt="Alt text" />        </td>
<td> The <strong>Mouth</strong> looks like a spinner but instead of 2nd level adjacent, they are 3rd level adjacent, so it looks like it is always opening and closing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/needle.png" alt="Alt text" />       </td>
<td> The <strong>Needle</strong> has a period of 2 and flips back and forth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/dancer.png" alt="Alt text" />       </td>
<td> The <strong>Dancer</strong> has a period of 2 and looks like its swinging back and forth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/star.png" alt="Alt text" />         </td>
<td> The <strong>Star</strong> looks like a twinkling star. It is quite peculiar in the sense that it has a period of 3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/rotator.png" alt="Alt text" />      </td>
<td> The <strong>Rotator</strong> has a period of 4 and looks like it is spinning in a weird way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/bat.png" alt="Alt text" />          </td>
<td> The <strong>Bat</strong> is perhaps the most common 4-period oscillator you get from random starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/snake.png" alt="Alt text" />        </td>
<td> The <strong>Snake</strong> is a period-4 oscillator that looks like a snake that wiggles around</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/morpher.png" alt="Alt text" />      </td>
<td> The <strong>Morpher</strong> is really simple but really interesting-looking oscillator. It has got a period of 12 and transforms into all its possible orientations. This means that even though it has no symmetry, it does not matter which way you orient it, it will achieve the same configurations. I call this temporal homogeneity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/tristar.png" alt="Alt text" />      </td>
<td> The <strong>Tristar</strong> is a period-12 oscillator that twinkles in a more elaborate way than the star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/images/hexlife/swimmer.png" alt="Alt text" />      </td>
<td> The <strong>Swimmer</strong> is an oscillator with a period of 48. You can actually find it on the Wikipedia page I linked. It seems like a lost fish swimming back and forth.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
