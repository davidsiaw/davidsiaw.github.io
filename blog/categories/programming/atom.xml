    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While debugging neuron, my new neural network simulation application, I found some (visually) interesting differences between online and batch learning. While batch learning is usually touted as a better form of learning, I found that the two don&rsquo;t seem to make much difference, except for a steppy curve from online learning, as I would expect as the gradient changes differently if you keep calculating the values in a cycle instead of calculating the combined gradient of all the training data.</p>

<p>Here are the results from training a 2-2-1 network with biases with XOR as training data:</p>

<p><a href="http://labs.astrobunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-neuron2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://labs.astrobunny.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-neuron2-500x81.jpg" alt="" title="Picture" width="500" height="81" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1204" /></a></p>

<p>with the weights initialized to:</p>

<p>double[] wx0 = { 0.1, 0.2 };
double[] wx1 = { 0.3, 0.4 };
double[] wx2 = { 0.5, 0.6 };</p>

<p>double wh0 = 0.7;
double wh1 = 0.9;
double wh2 = 1.1;</p>

<p>Where wx are the values between the input and hidden layer and wh are the values between the hidden and output layer.</p>

<p>Here is the network topography:</p>

    <updated>2012-12-12T00:00:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidsiaw.github.io/blog/2012/12/12/the-identity-of-an-array</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given two arrays of integers: a and b, what does (a == b) mean?</p>

<p>Most of us will say, it depends on the programming language you are using, and that is true. In the case of C, it means a and b are the pointers to the start of the same array. In Java and C# it means the arrays are Reference Equal, basically meaning that the pointer to the arrays a and b are the same.</p>

<p>But how is that really useful? If you passed around these two arrays and checked if the references are the same, you are really just comparing the object with itself or not. The object is never going to be equal to anything else but itself. Even another array created in a different part of the program that has exactly the same integers in it in the same order will be a different array.</p>

<p>One would agree that [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3] are the same but if these two arrays were created at different places the == operator will return false. Why is the extra information that the arrays are made in two different places important to the == operator? It makes no sense when you look at arrays as a list of numbers, and not a pointer into memory, which is an implementation detail.</p>

<p>So if we were to write a better == operator for arrays, what would it be?</p>

<p><code>
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3,3] -&gt; true
[1,2,3,3] == [3,2,1,3] -&gt; ?
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3,1,2,3] -&gt; ?
[1,2,3,3] == [2,3,1] -&gt; ?
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3] -&gt; ?
[1,2,3,3] == [1233] -&gt; ?
[1,2,3,3] == "1233" -&gt; ?
</code></p>

<p>We suddenly see that the array&rsquo;s identity changes depending on what you are using it for. Let us replace those question marks with context.</p>

<p><code>
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3,3] -&gt; true if the array is an ordered list
[1,2,3,3] == [3,2,1,3] -&gt; true if the array is an unordered list
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3,1,2,3] -&gt; true if the array is a bag of numbers
[1,2,3,3] == [2,3,1] -&gt; true if the array is an unordered set
[1,2,3,3] == [1,2,3] -&gt; true if the array is an ordered set
[1,2,3,3] == [1233] -&gt; true if the array is a collection of digits
[1,2,3,3] == "1233" -&gt; true if the array is a string
</code></p>

<p>The array is too general. It is actually really important that we know what the array represents. A whole bunch of things are arrays but are passed around as plain arrays. This causes maintainer programmers to wonder what exactly they represent.</p>

<p>Some cite performance reasons. Fair enough, passing a struct that contains an array and a set of methods to manipulate it in C is slower than just passing the struct around. C is a very low level language where implementation detail really mixes with requirements.</p>

<p>But why is it that so many other modern languages have this problem? Why isn&rsquo;t there a language that treats a set like a set, and has a compiler that really just compiles it down into an array?</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this problem does not stop at arrays. Numbers have different meanings in different contexts too. Take for example the function Math.Cos in C#. This function takes a double in <i>radians</i>.</p>

<p>Why is it that the function signature is</p>

<p><code>c#
double Cos(double angle)
</code></p>

<p>and not</p>

<p><code>c#
ratio Cos(radians angle)
</code></p>

<p>where radians is just a type of double?</p>

<p>If the compiler was fed this information the first place, programs like this:
<code>
degrees a = 40;
ratio r = Cos(a);
</code></p>

<p>will cause the compiler to either throw a compiler error for passing degrees into a radians parameter, or generate code to convert degrees to radians.</p>

    <link href="http://davidsiaw.github.io/blog/2012/11/28/exceptionless-programming/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T00:00:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidsiaw.github.io/blog/2012/11/28/exceptionless-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a big fan of writing code that generates no runtime errors. This is an implementation of a function that takes the first element of an array.</p>

<p>``` c++
template<typename T>
T first(std::vector<T> array)
{</p>

<pre><code>if (array.size() == 0) { throw EmptyArrayException(); }
return array[0];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is the standard way we are taught to write programs. However, there is another way to write this function that makes the exception unneccessary.</p>

<p>``` c++
template<typename T>
void first(std::vector<T> array, std::function&lt;void(T)> returnCallback)
{</p>

<pre><code>if (array.size() == 0)
{
    return;
}
returnCallback(array[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Suddenly the program flow is dictated by the emptiness of the array. Besides knowing well that this function will never throw an exception, the program that uses it will be structured in such a way that you can guarantee within the scope of the returnCallback function that was passed in, the function will always have the first element of the array. You don&rsquo;t even have to check for nullness.</p>

<p>``` c++
int calcCheckSum(std::vector<int> sorted)
{</p>

<pre><code>int result = 0;
first&lt;int&gt;(sorted, [&amp;amp;](int a)
{
    int&amp; res = result;
    last&lt;int&gt;(sorted, [&amp;amp;](int b)
    {
        res = a + b;
    });
});
return result;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And as a perk, if this function compiles, you know that it will run without errors.</p>
